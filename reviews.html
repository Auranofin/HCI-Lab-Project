The feedback from our guests was fantastic! The aromatic yellow rice, coupled with the spicy shredded beef and crispy anchovies, created a harmonious blend of flavors that everyone enjoyed. The savory egg strips and seasoned vegetables added a delightful variety, making each bite an adventure. The presentation was impeccable, and the garnishing with fresh cucumber slices and a hint of chili added the perfect finishing touch. At Rp25.000 per box, it provided an authentic taste of Indonesian cuisine and was a great value for such high-quality food. CAteriNgz's catering service was exceptional, ensuring that everything was delivered on time and in perfect condition. I highly recommend them for any event that requires a touch of traditional Indonesian flavor and excellent service!">

The grilled chicken skewers were marinated in exquisite Javanese herbs, delivering a burst of authentic flavors that our team couldn't stop raving about. Each skewer was perfectly tender and paired wonderfully with the rich, creamy peanut sauce, which added a delightful touch to the meal. The steamed rice cakes were a perfect complement, soaking up the flavors and providing a fulfilling experience. At Rp40.000 per box, it was an excellent value for the quality and authenticity we received. The catering service was professional, timely, and made our event a memorable one. I highly recommend CAteriNgz for anyone looking to add a delicious and authentic Javanese twist to their events!">

The garlic-glazed fried chicken was a crowd-pleaser, incredibly flavorful and tender. The stir-fried noodles and tempeh orek provided a satisfying mix of textures and tastes, and the coconut rice with crunchy Indonesian crackers completed the meal beautifully. However, there was a slight inconvenience as a few of the lunchboxes arrived slightly delayed, which impacted our schedule. Despite this minor hiccup, the quality and taste of the food were exceptional, making the Indonesian Delight a great choice for future events. At Rp30.000 per box, it was well worth it. I would recommend CAteriNgz for their delicious food and authentic Indonesian cuisine, but I hope they can improve their delivery punctuality.">
